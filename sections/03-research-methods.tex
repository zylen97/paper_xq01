\subsection{Methodology}
To address our RQs, this study adopted three methods: necessary condition analysis (NCA), time-series qualitative comparative analysis (TSQCA), and typical case tracing (TCT). The reasons are as follows. \textbf{\textit{First}}, NCA allows us to quantify the effect size of necessity, ensuring that we do not overlook critical prerequisites before examining configurations \citep{dul2016Necessary}. It is important for RQ1 to first ascertain whether any antecedent serves as a necessary condition. \textbf{\textit{Second}}, TSQCA is utilized to identify configurations related to our RQs. Traditional regression analysis is insufficient for capturing the \textit{conjunction} (factors working together), \textit{equifinality} (multiple pathways to the same outcome), and \textit{asymmetry} (presence and absence of factors having different effects) of antecedents \citep{ragin2009Redesigning,fiss2011Building}, which QCA can do. Given our panel dataset, TSQCA extends general QCA by assessing configurations' consistency and coverage over time \citep{denford2024Assessing}, enabling identification of robust configurations in a dynamic context. \textbf{\textit{Third}}, this study employed TCT to further build connections between identified configurations and the practices of construction enterprises. Established by \citet[p.~561]{schneider2013Combining}, TCT is a qualitative within-case method that traces good practice based on typical configurations. While TSQCA reveals which antecedents combine to form sufficient conditions, TCT can explicate how these factors interact by reconstructing the detailed "chain of evidence" \citep{álamos-concha2022Conservative}. The detailed methods and their relationships with our RQs are shown in Fig. 2.

\subsection{Data source and sample}
The empirical setting for this study comprises A-share listed Chinese construction enterprises. We selected Chinese construction enterprises because of their unique "high-velocity" characteristics. As the world's largest construction market, the Chinese construction sector is currently navigating a profound transition from extensive scale-driven growth to intensive quality-driven development \citep{wang2024Strategic}, allowing for a rigorous examination of how enterprises construct sustainable competitive advantages beyond simple market expansion.

The initial data were primarily sourced from the China Stock Market \& Accounting Research (CSMAR) database and the Wind Financial Terminal (WIND). The study period is set from 2014 to 2023. This decade captures a critical phase of structural transformation, characterized by market adjustments under the "new normal," the acceleration of digital transformation, and strict compliance requirements under the "dual carbon" goals \citep{das2021Developing,sharma2023Construction}. This period also includes exogenous shocks like COVID-19, enabling us to explore configurations with high organizational resilience. Descriptive statistics for all variables are provided in Table \ref{tab:descriptive}.

To ensure data accuracy and analytical robustness, the initial sample was subjected to a rigorous screening process. First, observations marked as "ST" (Special Treatment) or "*ST" during the sample period were excluded. Second, enterprises with significant missing data for key variables were removed to ensure comparability. Finally, a panel dataset of 115 listed construction enterprises was obtained, yielding a total of 1,061 enterprise-year observations.

\subsection{Measurements}
\subsubsection{Outcome variable}
\textbf{Sustainable competitive advantage (\textit{livaRatio})}. To measure sustainable competitive advantage, this study leverages long-term investor value appropriation (\textit{liva}) as the proxy. \textit{Liva} is defined as the net present value of the excess returns a firm generates for its investors over a specific time horizon, relative to the market’s cost of capital \citet{wibbens2020Introducing}. The formula of \textit{liva} is: 

\begin{equation}
liva = V_T - V_0 - \sum_{t=1}^{T} \frac{FCF_t}{(1+r)^t}
\end{equation}
where $V_0$ and $V_T$ denote the enterprise's market value at the beginning and end of the period, respectively; $FCF_t$ represents the free cash flow in period $t$; and $r$ is the weighted average cost of capital.

The reasons we used LIVA are threefold. First, consistent with \citet{barney1991Firm}, a sustainable competitive advantage must result in the appropriation of superior value over the long run. Second, unlike short-term accounting ratios (e.g., return on assets) or market expectations (e.g., Tobin's Q), \textit{liva} captures the cumulative economic magnitude of a firm's success, filtering out short-term accounting noise \citep{wibbens2020Introducing}. Third, by netting out the cost of capital, \textit{liva} effectively isolates the value created specifically by the firm's unique capabilities above the market average, rendering it a robust indicator of sustained advantage \citep{mizik2003Trading}. To ensure comparability across enterprises, the ratio of \textit{liva} to total assets (\textit{livaRatio}) is used for analysis.

\subsubsection{Resource-related conditions}
\textbf{Cost Stickiness (\textit{stick})}. We measured cost stickiness using the model proposed by \citet{weiss2010Cost}, which captures the asymmetric behavior of costs --- the tendency for costs to rise with increasing sales but fall disproportionately less when sales decline. The model is specified as:

\begin{equation}
stick_{i,t} = \log\left(\frac{\Delta cost}{\Delta sale}\right)_{i,\underline{\tau}} - \log\left(\frac{\Delta cost}{\Delta sale}\right)_{i,\bar{\tau}}
\end{equation}
where $\underline{\tau}$ represents the most recent quarter within the observation year (from $t$ to $t-3$) exhibiting a decline in sales, and $\bar{\tau}$ represents the most recent quarter exhibiting an increase. Here, $\Delta sale$ and $\Delta cost$ denote the year-over-year changes in sales and total operating costs, respectively. Since a lower negative value in the original Weiss model indicates higher stickiness, we multiplied the result by $-1$ to ensure that a higher $stick$ value corresponds to a greater degree of resource retention.

\textbf{Enterprise size (\textit{size})}. Enterprise size is measured as the natural logarithm of total assets at year-end.

\textbf{Environmental, social, and governance (\textit{esg})}. We measured ESG performance using the Sino-Securities ESG rating sourced from the Wind database, according to \citet{cheng2024Strategic}. This rating system aligns with international ESG evaluation frameworks while accommodating the specialties of the Chinese capital market, offering broad coverage, frequent updates and high data accessibility.

\textbf{Digital transformation (\textit{digit})}. According to \citet{zareie2024Firm}, \textit{digit} was quantified through textual analysis. A dictionary of construction-specific digital keywords (e.g., "smart site," "digital twin," "IoT") was constructed. The variable is measured by the frequency of these keywords relative to the total text in annual reports, capturing the extent of digital integration.

\subsubsection{Environment-related conditions}
\textbf{Environmental Dynamism (\textit{dynam})} and \textbf{Environmental Munificence (\textit{munif})}. Although all sample enterprises belong to the construction industry, they operate in distinct sub-industries with varying degrees of volatility. Therefore, to capture this heterogeneity, we referenced the \textit{"Guidelines for Industry Classification of Listed Companies"} issued by \citet{chinasecuritiesregulatorycommission2012Guidelines} to categorize the sample enterprises into four distinct sub-industries: Building Construction (E47), Civil Engineering Construction (E48), Building Installation (E49), and Building Decoration and Other Construction (E50). Following \citet{ghosh2009Environmental}, we measured \textit{dynam} and \textit{munif} for each sub-industry using a time-series forecasting model based on aggregated revenue data. To capture environmental dynamics, we adopted a \textbf{5-year rolling window} approach. For each sub-industry $j$ in year $t$, we regressed total revenue ($S_{j\tau}$) against time ($\tau$) over the window $[\text{t}-4, \text{t}]$ (where $\tau \in \{1, \dots, 5\}$):
\begin{equation}
S_{j\tau} = \alpha_j + \beta_j \tau + \epsilon_{j\tau}
\end{equation}
Using the sub-industry's mean revenue ($\bar{S}_j$) to normalize for scale, we calculated two environment-related conditions. First, \textit{dynam} proxies market volatility using the standard error of the slope ($se_{\beta_j}$): $dynam_{i,t} = se_{\beta_j}/\bar{S}_j$. Second, \textit{munif} represents growth potential using the regression slope coefficient ($\beta_j$): $munif_{i,t} = \beta_j/\bar{S}_j$.

\subsubsection{Strategy-related conditions}
\textbf{Diversification (\textit{diver})}. Following strategic management literature \citep{palepu1985Diversification}, this study employed the entropy index of revenues to measure diversification. Compared to simple counts of business segments or dummy variables, the entropy index is superior as it captures two dimensions simultaneously: the \textit{scope} of businesses (number of segments) and the \textit{balance} of total sales distributed across these segments. To ensure the accurate categorization of the construction industry, we strictly adopted the classification standards from the \textit{"Guidelines for Industry Classification of Listed Companies"} \citep{chinasecuritiesregulatorycommission2012Guidelines}. The variable is calculated as:
\begin{equation}
diver = \sum_{i=1}^{n} p_i \ln(1/p_i)
\end{equation}
where $p_i$ represents the proportion of sales revenue from the $i$-th business segment to the firm's total revenue, and $n$ denotes the total number of business segments.

\textbf{Differentiation (\textit{diff}) and Cost Leadership (\textit{lead})}. Following the methodology of \citet{banker2024Strategy}, we quantified these two conditions via textual analysis of the "Management Discussion and Analysis" (MD\&A) section in annual reports. To adapt to the construction industry context, we constructed two distinct keyword dictionaries. For \textit{diff}, the word set focuses on uniqueness and technical superiority (e.g., "technological innovation," "green building," "BIM"). For \textit{lead}, the word set emphasizes efficiency and expense reduction (e.g., "cost control," "lean construction," "supply chain optimization"). \textit{Diff} and \textit{lead} are measured as the ratio of the respective keyword frequency to the total word count of the MD\&A section.

\subsection{Variable calibration}
Variable calibration is the critical procedure of transforming raw data into fuzzy-set membership scores ranging from 0 to 1. We employed the direct calibration method based on sample percentiles, a standard practice in large-sample QCA \citep{fiss2007Settheoretic}. Specifically, we defined the three qualitative anchors based on the data distribution: the threshold for full membership was set at the 90th percentile, the crossover point at the 50th percentile, and the threshold for full non-membership at the 10th percentile. To prevent case dropout during the truth table analysis caused by maximum ambiguity, cases with membership scores of 0.5 were adjusted to 0.501, following the recommendation of \citet{fiss2011Building}. Table \ref{tab:descriptive} presents calibration thresholds.
