\section{Results and Discussion}
\label{sec:results}

Our computational experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The algorithm consistently converges to Nash equilibrium within 50 iterations across all test scenarios.

The utility function defined in Equation \ref{eq:utility} provides a robust framework for modeling agent interactions, while the equilibrium conditions in Equations \ref{eq:nash_condition} and \ref{eq:non_negativity} ensure solution stability.
