\subsection{Necessary conditions analysis results}

Table \ref{tab:nca} presents the NCA results using both ceiling regression and ceiling envelopment techniques \citep{dul2016Necessary}. According to established NCA standards, a condition is considered necessary only if it meets two criteria simultaneously: the effect size is not less than 0.1 ($d \ge 0.1$), and the Monte Carlo simulation permutation test shows that the effect size is statistically significant ($p < 0.05$) \citep{dul2016Necessary}. The empirical data reveal that the effect sizes for eight out of the nine antecedent conditions are 0.000, indicating absolutely no bottleneck effect. The only exception is cost Stickiness, which exhibits a minor effect size ($d_{CE} = 0.077$, $d_{CR} = 0.039$). However, this value remains below the 0.1 threshold, and the permutation tests yield non-significant results for all conditions (p-values = 1.000). These statistics confirm that no single factor constitutes a necessary condition for achieving sustainable competitive advantage.

Furthermore, the bottleneck level analysis (see Table S1 in Supplementary Materials) corroborates these findings. While \textit{stick} shows a localized bottleneck level of 27.2\% strictly at the highest tier of performance (70\%--100\%), for all other performance levels and conditions, the bottleneck requirement is consistently "Not Necessary" (NN). This suggests that while maintaining slack resources (cost stickiness) may act as a threshold condition for achieving elite status, it is not a prerequisite for sustainable competitive advantage.

\subsection{Sufficient configuration results}
Standard QCA procedures yield three types of solutions: complex, parsimonious, and intermediate. Complex solutions often lead to many configurations that are difficult to interpret. Parsimonious solutions incorporate all logical remainders to maximize simplicity, potentially producing results that are detached from empirical reality. To address these limitations, this study adopts the intermediate solution. The intermediate solution strikes an optimal balance between the complexity of the complex solution and the over-simplification of the parsimonious solution \citep{ragin2006Set}. This approach ensures that the findings are both theoretically grounded and empirically interpretable, a practice particularly recommended for maintaining robustness in panel data QCA \citep{guedes2016UK}. Consequently, the analysis that follows focuses on the 10 configurations derived from the intermediate solution, as detailed in Table \ref{tab:tsqca}.

\subsubsection{Consistency Analysis}
Consistency serves as the primary criterion for evaluating configurations' validity. TSQCA assesses consistency through three metrics: pooled consistency (POCONS), between-case consistency (BECONS), and within-case consistency (WICONS) \citep{castro2016General}. We selected POCONS and BECONS for our analysis because our aim is to investigate the general patterns and temporal evolution trends across construction enterprises, rather than focusing on trajectories of individual case. 

POCONS assesses the strength of the sufficiency relationship between each configuration and high sustainable competitive advantage across the study period and all cases. As reported in Table \ref{tab:tsqca}, the POCONS values for all 8 configurations range from 0.893 to 0.950, exceeding the recommended threshold of 0.80 \citep{ragin2009Redesigning}. This indicates that all identified configurations act as valid and reliable sufficient conditions for achieving sustainable competitive advantage.

BECONS considers temporal effects by calculating the degree of sufficiency of condition combinations for the outcome variable based on data at each specific time point \citep{guedes2016UK}. Table \ref{tab:tsqca} suggests that annual BECONS values exhibit notable temporal variation throughout the study period. For instance, configurations C1b and C2a experience pronounced fluctuations, with BECONS values dropping to as low as 0.678 and 0.745 in 2017, before recovering in subsequent years. To quantify this volatility, we further computed the BECONS distance, which measures the deviation of annual consistency from the pooled consistency. Higher BECONS distances indicate more substantial temporal fluctuations. BECONS distances for all configurations exceed the 0.004 threshold \citep{castro2016General}, confirming significant temporal volatility ang the necessity of TSQCA.

\subsubsection{Coverage Analysis}
Coverage assesses the empirical relevance and explanatory power of each configuration, indicating the proportion of the outcome set explained by a specific configuration. Variations in coverage values reflect changes in the explanatory strength of strategic configurations for achieving high sustainable competitive advantage. Specifically, coverage in panel data QCA comprises three metrics: pooled coverage (POCOV), between-case coverage (BECOV), and within-case coverage (WICOV). Following the analytical approach adopted in the consistency analysis, we first examine POCOV in this section and subsequently explore BECOV in the "Further Analysis" section.

As shown in Table \ref{tab:tsqca}, POCOV values vary across configurations. Notably, configurations C4b (0.237), C3a (0.232), C5a (0.231), and C2a (0.229) exhibit the highest coverage, suggesting they represent the most dominant patterns in the industry. A deeper inspection of these high-coverage configurations reveals a compelling commonality: they predominantly feature a combination of differentiation and cost leadership strategies (i.e., a hybrid strategy) synergized with key organizational resources like ESG performance and digital transformation. This underscores a critical trend in the contemporary Chinese construction market: pure strategies alone have limited explanatory power. Instead, the paradigm for success has shifted towards the integration of dual business advantages supplemented by modern organizational capabilities.

\subsection{Typical case tracing results}
To further illustrate the identified configurations, we conducted typical case tracing and configuration explanation in three steps. First, we employed typical case tracing to identify typical cases representing configurations \cite{schneider2013Combining}. Second, we consolidated and labeled configurations into broader patterns based on the similarity and dissimilarity of their antecedent conditions, identifying four distinct configuration groups. Third, we conducted qualitative content analysis of the "Business Overview" and "Management Discussion and Analysis" sections from the annual reports of typical construction enterprises within the five consolidated patterns, developing theoretical propositions accordingly.

\subsubsection{Innovation-Responsibility Dual-Driven Configuration (Configurations C1a, C1b)}

Configurations C1a ($\sim \textit{stick} * \textit{esg} * \textit{digit} * \textit{dynam} * \textit{diver} * \textit{diff}$) and C1b ($\textit{size} * \textit{esg} * \textit{digit} * \sim \textit{munif} * \sim \textit{diver} * \textit{diff}$) represent a strategic paradigm we term the \textbf{"Innovation-Responsibility Dual-Driven Configuration."} The characteristic of these configurations is the simultaneous presence of differentiation strategy ($\textit{diff}$), superior ESG performance ($\textit{esg}$), and deep digital transformation ($\textit{digit}$). This configuration depicts an industry leader that transcends traditional low-cost competition by positioning technological innovation and social responsibility as differentiating advantages. 

According to the "principle of maximum set membership," \textbf{China State Construction Engineering Corporation (CSCEC)} is identified as the typical case for these configurations. Specificially, in terms of digital differentiation, CSCEC has developed proprietary "C-Smart" management platforms and independently controlled digital techiniques that define industry standards, such as the comprehensive application of digital twin technology in complex landmark structures \citep{cscec2024China}. Regarding ESG performance, CSCEC completed the construction of the Huoshenshan and Leishenshan hospitals within days, a feat made by the integration of prefabricated modular construction and an unwavering commitment to public health \citep{tan2021Integrated}. Furthermore, its aggressive promotion of green buildings and zero-carbon industrial parks serves as a tangible response to national "dual carbon" goals. 

Based on the "Resource-Environment-Strategy" framework, the formation mechanism of sustainable competitive advantage for this configuration follows a cumulative "Resource-Strategy" mutual reinforcement logic. Specifically, CSCEC integrates tangible digital capabilities (\textit{digit}) with intangible legitimacy resources (\textit{esg}). This integration is not merely additive but synergistic: proprietary digital technologies (e.g., BIM, smart sites) provide precise data support for ESG management, while high-standard ESG mandates (e.g., "dual carbon" goals) conversely drive the demand for deep technological innovation. Building upon this dual-resource foundation, the enterprise successfully deployed a differentiation strategy (\textit{diff}) to navigate environmental dynamism (\textit{dynam}). Fig. 1 illustrates the configurational pathways of C1a and C1b.

\begin{center}[Insert Fig. 1 here]\end{center}

\subsubsection{Digital-Enabled Lean Scale Archetype (Configurations C2a, C2b)}
Configurations C2a ($\sim \textit{diver} * \textit{diff} * \textit{cost} * \textit{dynam} * \textit{size} * \textit{digit}$) and C2b ($\sim \textit{diff} * \textit{cost} * \textit{munif} * \textit{size} * \textit{digit}$) reveal a robust leadership model prevalent in the infrastructure sector, which we term the \textbf{"Digital-Enabled Lean Scale Archetype."} The core logic of this paradigm is that the enterprise leverages its immense organizational size ($\textit{size}$) as a foundation, steadfastly executes a cost leadership strategy ($\textit{cost}$), and deploys deep digital transformation ($\textit{digit}$) as a critical catalyst. Unlike traditional contractors who rely on labor-intensive scale, this archetype utilizes digital tools to convert static scale advantages into dynamic, inimitable efficiency advantages, thereby mitigating the diseconomies of scale often found in mega-projects.

According to the set membership data, \textbf{China Communications Construction Company (CCCC)} stands out as the paradigmatic case. As a global leader in ultra-large infrastructure (e.g., ports, roads, bridges), CCCC faces extreme pressure to control costs while managing vast, geographically dispersed assets. This configuration accurately reflects its strategic pivot: moving from "extensive expansion" to "intensive management" via digitalization.

Specifically, CCCC has successfully implemented this model through its digital supply chain and smart engineering. To support its cost leadership strategy, CCCC established a centralized digital procurement platform that leverages its massive scale ($\textit{size}$) to negotiate lower material prices, significantly reducing marginal costs. Furthermore, in landmark projects like the \textit{Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge} and the \textit{Shenzhen-Zhongshan Link}, CCCC utilized full-lifecycle BIM and intelligent manufacturing of steel structures. This digital approach minimized construction errors and rework—the primary sources of cost overruns in infrastructure—thereby achieving "lean construction" at a mega scale. By integrating the Beidou satellite system for high-precision positioning in offshore operations, CCCC further optimized operational efficiency under complex environmental conditions. These practices validate that for infrastructure giants, digitalization is not just for differentiation but is the essential prerequisite for executing a viable cost leadership strategy.
