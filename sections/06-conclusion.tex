\section{Conclusion and Future Work}
\label{sec:conclusion}

This study successfully demonstrates the application of game-theoretic approaches to multi-agent engineering management problems. Our key contributions include:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item A novel mathematical framework combining game theory with optimization
    \item Computational algorithms that efficiently solve large-scale problems
    \item Empirical validation showing significant performance improvements
\end{enumerate}

Future research directions include extending the model to dynamic environments and incorporating uncertainty in agent behaviors.
