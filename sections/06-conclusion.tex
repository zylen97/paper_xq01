\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

This study successfully demonstrates the application of game-theoretic approaches to multi-agent engineering management problems. Our key contributions include:

很多CEM研究提到了可持续竞争优势，但都是含沙射影，没有真正去聚焦，去基于可持续竞争优势进行测量。

\begin{enumerate}
    \item A novel mathematical framework combining game theory with optimization
    \item Computational algorithms that efficiently solve large-scale problems
    \item Empirical validation showing significant performance improvements
\end{enumerate}

Future research directions include extending the model to dynamic environments and incorporating uncertainty in agent behaviors.
